# Financial-Market-Analysis
This project is based on data analysis, visualization, classification and predictions of various company stocks.

# Description

Used Pandas in Python to get stock information, visualize the data and analyze the risk of a stock based on its previous performance history. Also performed machine learning models for classification and prediction of stocks.

This is done in Jupyter (IPython Notebook).

# MODULE1: STOCK DATA ANALYSIS

Analysing and exploring the stock data of Amazon.

Using pandas library for Data Cleaning and Data Wrangling. Analysing the stock information and obtaining the Volume Weighted Average Pric,OHLC Average Price,Loss/Profit percentage over the last N days, daily percentage change of the stocks, the daily trend and the median and average of Total Traded Quantity wrt the trend.

# MODULE2: DATA VISUALIZATION

This module performs exploratory data analysis and visualisation of the Amazon Market Stock. Using MatplotLib and Seaborn to find the correlation between different stocks and their diversification, to perform several plotting of graphs, to obtain basic technical indicators, to obtain the beta factor by calculating volatility and to make our own trade calls using simple moving average (SMA) and Bollinger Bands.

# MODULE3: FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS USING REGRESSION

Regression is basically a statistical approach to find the relationship between variables. 

In this module a regressional model is created for recognizing discrepancies in prediction. CAPM Analysis and Beta Calculation is performed. Linear regression(OLS) is to find Beta values.

# MODULE4: TRADE CALL PREDICTION USING CLASSIFICATION

Utilizing Classification to make a trade call and measure the efficiency of each trading algorithm using models like Random Forest Classifier, SVM Classifier, Logistic Regression and KNN Classifier.

# MODULE5: MODERN PORTFOLIO THEORY

This module calculates the mean daily return and daily standard deviation of returns of several stocks and annualising them to get mean expected annual return and volatility. 

A Scatter Plot is obtained of the portfolios wrt Sharpe Ratio and Lowest Volatility.

# MODULE6: CLUSTERING FOR DIVERSIFICATION ANALYSIS
This module calculates the average percentage return and volatility of 30 Stocks over 1 year period and K-Means Clustering is applied to group similar stocks based on their performance in the market.

# This Project is a part of the Machine Learning Internship done at Career Launcher.
